        <h1><a href="index.html">Twisted Ribbons Interactive Art</a></h1>
        <p>We're a team of five students creating an interactive art exhibit in 3 months.</p>

        <h2>Our art installation, Janis, is an interactive, nontraditional clock. Using a series of rotating paddles, Janis conveys the time accurately and attractively, while asking for a bit of deciphering on the side of the user. If someone approaches Janis, she stops conveying the time and instead plays a game of mimicry with the person in proximity. This play causes the user to lose track of time in more ways than one.</h2>

        <h1>Project Goals</h1>
        <h2>From the start, our team wanted to create a polished interaction that could stand alone as an art installation. We envision these components as critical to Janis's success:</h2>

        <div class = "section">
          <h2>Aesthetics:</h2>
          <p>We put aesthetics front and center throughout all our sprints. All cut lines are clean, and the wood is painted black. The glossy black paddles catch light as they turn. The wires, glued in straight lines, are tucked away in the back of Janis. Finally, a white illuminated backdrop is the finishing touch, in stark contrast with the black paddles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "section">
          <h2>Documentation:</h2>
          <p>Our team wanted to document Janis’s development through pictures, videos, and blog posts. As a playful interactive piece, Janis lends herself to an interesting story. The blog section of our website tells the story of Janis’s development and our team’s journey, including any obstacles and pivots.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "section">
          <h2>Motion and Interaction:</h2>
          <p>Experimenting with different interactions is extremely important for our team. We envision Janis’s interaction as fun and playful, and experimented with various motion controls to achieve this. Though we hoped to experiment more than we could by the deadline, we learned a lot about team integration through the process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "section">
          <h2>A Home Afterwards:</h2>
          <p>We don't want our project to live in the shadows after POE. Our team made sure Janis could interact with people after this project finished. After talking to Jeff Goldstein, we learned the library lower level doesn’t have a large clock display, and could be a compelling home for Janis.</p>
