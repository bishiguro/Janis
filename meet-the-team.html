                    <small>Electrical Co-Lead</small>
                <p>Jason is a sophomore majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Olin College. He is interested in machine learning, cooking, film and soccer. In this project, he is co-heading the ECE subteam with Meg. He working on wiring up the whole system and getting sensor input. Jason is also going to explore  3D printing and some machine shop skills throughout the project.</p>

                <p>Meg is a junior at Olin, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a software focus. To further her future goals of becoming a full stack engineer, Meg wanted to explore website development, so she took point on designing and creating the website for this project. She is also co-heading the electrical and computer subteam with Jason, working on the circuitry side of things and integration between the Arduino and the electrical parts. Meg loves chocolate, running, and curling up in a comfy chair with a good book.</p>

                    <small>Software Co-Lead</small>
                <p>Shrinidhi is a junior at Olin, and Engineering with Computing major. She is particularly interested in the intersection of engineering and design, so this project as an art installation requiring technical skills, called to her. On the team, she primarily works with Bonnie to visualize sensor input as interesting wave patterns, through Arduino and python code. On a later phase of the project, she hopes to transition to aesthetic design of the product, working closer with Charlie.</p>
